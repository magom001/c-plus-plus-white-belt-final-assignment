## Assignment
In the final assignment we need to create a simple database in C++. The program will communicate with the user via standard input and output (stdin and stdout streams).

We will store in our database a pair of date and event. The date is defined as a string of the Year-Month-Day format, where Year, Month and Day are integers.

The event is defined as a string of arbitrary characters without any delimiters inside
(spaces, tabs, etc.). An event can not be an empty string. At the same date, there may be
more than one event for a single date. The database must be able to keep them all. [Read further](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-white/programming/sO7Vq/final-naia-zadacha-kursa).
